# Celo Builders

Base URL: `https://celobuilders.xyz`

Use this skill to help a builder find the right Celo Builders hackathon, understand the rules and bounties, connect their account, draft a project submission, and publish it only after they approve.

## Stay Up To Date

This file is a snapshot; the live version is always at `https://celobuilders.xyz/skill.md`. Fetch it at the start of a session and follow it if it differs from this copy. If any API error response includes a `skillHint` field, or a documented route returns `404`, this copy is outdated: re-fetch the live instructions (or reinstall with `npx skills add https://celobuilders.xyz`) and retry the request following the current version.

## Agent Behavior

- Talk to the builder in plain language. Keep connection details internal unless they explicitly ask.
- Before asking the builder to connect, explain it simply: "I'll open a secure sign-in page. After you finish, paste the short code here so I can continue."
- Never invent dates, rules, bounties, tracks, FAQs, or judging criteria.
- Use `/hackathons/:id/ask` when the builder asks a question about a hackathon, and show the returned source labels.
- Ask before collecting personal or project information.
- Never include private keys, seed phrases, private repo credentials, or secrets in a submission.
- Treat drafts as private. Publish only after the builder confirms the final version.

## Discover Hackathons

List hackathons:

```bash
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons
```

Fetch details for the selected hackathon. The examples below use the current public hackathon slug; always list hackathons first and use the slug the builder chooses. Always check `/submission-fields` (also mirrored at `metadata.submissionFields`) before collecting project details — organizers configure extra required fields per hackathon.

```bash
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents/submission-fields
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents/timeline
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents/rules
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents/tracks
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents/bounties
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents/judging-criteria
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents/faqs
```

Each submission field has a `key`, `label`, `type` (`text`, `url`, `email`, `number`, `boolean`, `select`, `multiselect`, or `address`), a `required` flag, and optional `helpText`, `allowedHosts` (for `url`), or `options` (for `select`/`multiselect`). Collect a value from the builder for every required field and send the values in the `customFields` object of the submission, keyed by `key`.

When selecting tracks or bounties, use the `slug` values from `/tracks` and `/bounties` in the submission payload. Do not use display titles. UUID `id` values are accepted for compatibility, but slugs are preferred and are what exports store.

Ask a hackathon question:

```bash
curl -X POST https://celobuilders.xyz/hackathons/celo-onchain-agents/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "question": "What are the bounties and submission deadline?" }'
```

## Submission Intake Checklist

Before connecting or drafting, collect the details needed for the selected hackathon:

- Builder name, email, social handle, team name, and agent name
- Project name, one-line tagline, short description, track targets, and bounty targets
- GitHub repository URL: must be a public `github.com/owner/repo` repository link, not a profile or another host. Publishing verifies the repository is publicly reachable, so ask the builder to make it public first.
- Demo URL, if available
- Ask whether they have a video URL; use `videoUrl` if they do, otherwise leave it out
- Celo network, using exactly one of: `celo-mainnet`, `celo-sepolia`, `not-applicable`. Some hackathons restrict the allowed values — if the submission fields list has a `celoNetwork` entry, only its `options` are accepted.
- Contract addresses, if applicable
- How the agent helped build the project
- A real value for every field returned by `/hackathons/:id/submission-fields`, respecting each field's type and `required` flag. Never use placeholders for these values.

For `celo-onchain-agents`, ask for the real Twitter/X registration post link up front. This is required, must be the builder's public X/Twitter post about the submission, and must be sent as `socialLink`. Never use a placeholder for `socialLink`.

Remind builders that joining the hackathon Telegram is important for updates. The link is on the hackathon page at `https://celobuilders.xyz/`.

## Connect Builder

After the intake details are ready, start the connection flow:

```bash
curl -X POST https://celobuilders.xyz/auth/google/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "hackathonId": "celo-onchain-agents",
    "human": {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "social": "@janedoe",
      "teamName": "AgentPay"
    },
    "agent": {
      "name": "Jane coding agent",
      "harness": "codex",
      "model": "gpt-5"
    }
  }'
```

Ask the builder to open the returned sign-in link. When the browser shows a short code, ask them to paste it back.

Finish the connection:

```bash
curl -X POST https://celobuilders.xyz/auth/google/claim \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "claimCode": "CELO-ABCD-2345" }'
```

The claim response also includes a `skill` object — `{ sha256, latest, hint }` — describing the currently served version of this skill. If `sha256` differs from the SHA-256 of your installed SKILL.md, your copy is outdated: re-fetch `latest` or reinstall with `npx skills add https://celobuilders.xyz` before continuing.

Store the returned connection credential privately and use it silently for authenticated requests.

## Builder Profile

View the connected builder:

```bash
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/participants/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <connection>"
```

Update optional profile fields:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://celobuilders.xyz/participants/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <connection>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "teamName": "AgentPay", "socialHandle": "@janedoe" }'
```

## Register Early (get your attribution tag)

Registering is just saving a first draft with the basics — fields whose `requiredAt` is `"registration"` in `/hackathons/:id/submission-fields` (typically project name, GitHub repository, and a contact handle). Everything else can come later; required `"submission"`-stage fields only gate publishing.

```bash
curl -X PUT https://celobuilders.xyz/submissions/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <connection>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectName": "AgentPay",
    "githubUrl": "https://github.com/example/agentpay",
    "trackIds": ["best-agent"],
    "customFields": { "telegram": "@janedoe", "agentWalletAddress": "0x1234...abcd" }
  }'
```

If the builder already has an agent wallet, include `agentWalletAddress` at registration even though it is only required to publish — x402 facilitator settlements are attributed to that wallet, and the leaderboard shows them as soon as it is on file (attribution is retroactive across the whole hackathon window, but the leaderboard reads zero until the wallet is added). If there is no wallet yet, add it to the submission the moment one exists.

The response includes `attributionTag` (`celo_` + 12 hex characters) — the builder's on-chain attribution tag, derived from the GitHub `owner/repo` slug and locked to the first saved value (later URL edits do not change it). Show it to the builder right away with the integration one-liner:

```ts
import { toDataSuffix } from '@celo/attribution-tags'
await wallet.sendTransaction({ to, value, data: toDataSuffix('<attributionTag>') })
```

**Your assigned tag must be in every transaction.** Leaderboards only credit the `attributionTag` returned at registration — a code you derive yourself (e.g. `codeFromHostname`) or brought from another program is a different value and is not credited on its own. Already tagging with your own code? Keep it — ERC-8021 suffixes carry multiple codes. Pass an array and include the assigned tag:

```ts
const tag = toDataSuffix(['your_existing_code', '<attributionTag>'])
```

Only add codes that represent your own app — platform codes like `minipay` are added by the platform, not by you.

After the first tagged transaction, verify the loop is closed: decode the transaction (`verifyTx` in the SDK) and confirm the codes include the registered `attributionTag` from `GET /submissions/me`.

## Project Submission

Before publishing a project, make sure all required fields are present, including every hackathon-specific field from `/hackathons/:id/submission-fields`. Hackathon-specific values go in the `customFields` object, keyed by each field's `key`. The one exception is `socialLink`, which is sent top-level. For `celo-onchain-agents`, the required Twitter/X registration post link goes in `socialLink`. Builders can create or update their project until the hackathon end time, including updates to an already-published project. Always include at least one `trackIds` value when the hackathon has tracks.

Create or update the project:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://celobuilders.xyz/submissions/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <connection>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectName": "AgentPay",
    "tagline": "An onchain payment assistant for everyday transactions",
    "description": "A Celo agent that helps users prepare, verify, and send useful payment transactions.",
    "trackIds": ["best-agent"],
    "bountyIds": ["best-agent-1st"],
    "githubUrl": "https://github.com/example/agentpay",
    "demoUrl": "https://example.com",
    "videoUrl": "https://youtu.be/example",
    "socialLink": "https://x.com/janedoe/status/1234567890",
    "celoNetwork": "celo-sepolia",
    "contractAddresses": ["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"],
    "agentContributionNotes": "Agent helped implement the transaction flow, tests, and submission draft.",
    "customFields": {
      "erc8004Url": "https://www.8004scan.io/agents/celo/42",
      "agentWalletAddress": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
    }
  }'
```

The `customFields` example above shows fields a hackathon might configure; always send exactly the keys returned by `/hackathons/:id/submission-fields` for the selected hackathon. Sending keys that are not configured is rejected with a `400`. For backward compatibility, configured field values sent as top-level properties are also accepted, but prefer `customFields`.

For `celo-onchain-agents`, valid `trackIds` slugs are `best-agent`, `8004scan-rank`, and `most-activity`. Valid `bountyIds` slugs are `best-agent-1st`, `best-agent-2nd`, `best-agent-3rd`, `8004scan-rank-1st`, and `most-activity-1st`.

Review the project:

```bash
curl https://celobuilders.xyz/submissions/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <connection>"
```

Publish only after clear builder approval and before the hackathon end time:

```bash
curl -X POST https://celobuilders.xyz/submissions/me/publish \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <connection>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "confirm": true }'
```
